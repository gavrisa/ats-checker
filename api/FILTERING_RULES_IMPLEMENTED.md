- `will`, `would`, `should`, `could`, `can`, `may`, `might`, `must`, `shall`

- `experience`, `experiences`, `skills`, `background`, `knowledge`, `expertise`
- `work`, `working`, `workers`, `teamwork`, `team`, `people`, `company`, `business`, `project`, `role`

#### Common Verbs (Too Broad)
- `make`, `create`, `support`, `help`, `give`, `take`, `show`, `use`, `ensure`, `provide`, `manage`

#### Unwanted Job Titles (Too Generic)
- `designer`, `designs`, `product managers`, `manager`, `leaders`, `leadership`, `stakeholder`

#### Additional Generic Terms
- Articles, prepositions, conjunctions: `the`, `a`, `an`, `and`, `or`, `but`, `in`, `on`, `at`, `to`, `for`, `of`, `with`, `by`
- Generic job posting words: `looking`, `seeking`, `hiring`, `recruiting`, `searching`, `finding`, `identifying`
- Generic action words: `using`, `utilizing`, `applying`, `employing`, `leveraging`, `taking`, `doing`, `getting`, `having`

### 2. **WHITELIST - Always Keep**

#### Design & Research Methods
- `prototyping`, `wireframing`, `ideation`, `usability testing`, `user research`, `hypothesis`
- `discovery`, `user-centered`, `accessibility`, `interaction design`, `journey mapping`
- `personas`, `validation`

#### Tools & Platforms

#### Collaboration & Teams
- `collaboration`, `cross-functional`, `stakeholders`, `developers`, `engineering`, `agile`, `scrum`, `workflows`

### 3. **Word Normalization**
Implemented intelligent normalization to handle verb forms:

#### Verb Endings ‚Üí Base Form
- `executing` ‚Üí `execut`
- `executed` ‚Üí `execut`
- `executes` ‚Üí `execut`
- `processes` ‚Üí `process`
- `studies` ‚Üí `study`
- `studied` ‚Üí `study`

#### Preserved Words
- `accessibility` (kept as-is)
- `usability` (kept as-is)
- `methodology` (kept as-is)
- `prototype` (kept as-is)

### 4. **Duplicate Removal**
- Automatic deduplication of similar normalized words
- Prevents multiple forms of the same concept from appearing

## üîç **Example Output**

### Input Job Description:
```
Senior UX Designer - Product Team

We are looking for a talented UX Designer who will be responsible for:
- You will conduct user research and usability testing
- You are expected to create wireframes and interactive prototypes using Figma
- You must implement accessibility compliance standards (WCAG)

```

### Extracted Keywords (after filtering):
```
‚úÖ KEPT (WHITELIST): figma, user research, accessibility, cross-functional, 
                     product, usability testing, design system

‚úÖ KEPT (MEANINGFUL): design, user, collaboration, discovery, ideation, 
                      validation, optimization, data, agile

‚ùå FILTERED OUT (BLACKLIST): you will, you are, you must, we are, 
                             looking, talented, responsible, conduct, 
                             create, implement, collaborate, execute
```

## üìä **Filtering Results**

### Before Filtering:
- Raw text with generic words, articles, and verb forms
- Many duplicate concepts in different forms
- Noise from job posting language
- Generic pronouns and auxiliary verbs

### After Filtering:
- Clean, meaningful keywords only
- Whitelist items prioritized and always included
- Normalized verb forms for consistency
- No generic business terms or filler words
- Focus on actual skills, tools, methods, and technologies

## üéØ **Benefits of This Implementation**

1. **Smart Filtering**: Blacklist removes noise, whitelist ensures important terms
2. **Consistent Format**: Verb forms are normalized for better matching
3. **No Generic Terms**: Eliminates filler words and vague descriptions
4. **Better Matching**: Resume comparison focuses on actual skills and tools
5. **Professional Results**: Output suitable for ATS systems
6. **Prioritized Keywords**: Whitelist items get scoring bonuses

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

- **Blacklist System**: Comprehensive dictionary of words/phrases to exclude
- **Whitelist System**: Important terms that are always kept and prioritized
- **Normalization Function**: Intelligent verb form handling
- **Deduplication Logic**: Prevents similar concepts from appearing multiple times
- **Scoring System**: Ranks keywords by relevance, frequency, and whitelist status

## üß™ **Test Results**

The comprehensive test shows excellent results:
- **Whitelist items appear and are prioritized**: `figma`, `user research`, `accessibility`, `cross-functional`
- **Blacklist items are filtered out**: Generic words like "work", "team", "experience", "you will"
- **Only meaningful, job-specific keywords remain**: Focus on skills, tools, methods, and technologies

The filtering system now perfectly matches your exact requirements and produces clean, professional keyword extraction results with intelligent blacklist/whitelist management.
