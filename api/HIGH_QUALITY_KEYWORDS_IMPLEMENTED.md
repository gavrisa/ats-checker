# High-Quality JD Keywords - Implementation Complete! 🎉

## 🎯 **What Has Been Implemented**

I've successfully implemented the **comprehensive backend patch for high-quality JD keywords** that eliminates all HR/marketing terms, fragments, and generic language while preserving only meaningful, job-specific skills and tools.

## ✅ **New Advanced Features**

### 1. **Strict Category-Based Whitelist**

#### **Only Keep Candidates From These Categories**
```
✅ Methods & practices: prototyping, usability testing, user research, accessibility, 
   interaction design, discovery, ideation, end-to-end design, design systems

✅ Tools/tech: figma, sketch, miro, jira, confluence, analytics

✅ Deliverables/artefacts: wireframes, flows, journey maps, personas, design tokens

✅ Process/frameworks: agile, scrum, a/b testing, design ops

✅ Outcome/metrics (when paired): conversion optimization, kpi, experimentation
```

#### **Everything Else Defaults to Drop**
- Generic nouns, bare stems, fragments, filler words
- HR/marketing language, location terms, employment details
- Role titles, generic job descriptions
- Sensitive/domain-specific content

### 2. **Comprehensive Phrase-Level Blacklist**

#### **HR / Employment / Location / Recruiting**
```
❌ fully, remote, fully remote, europe, eu, relocation, visa, join, please, 
   looking, portfolios, apply, benefits, compensation
```

#### **Generic Nouns & Bare Stems**
```
❌ client, clients, user, users, mobile, platform, content, app, apps, 
   product, portfolio, senior, designer
```
*Note: These are kept ONLY when part of allowed bigrams like "mobile app design"*

#### **Fragments & Filler**
```
❌ look, that, products that, end design, what, ideally, corporate, craft, plu
```

#### **Role/Level Titles**
```
❌ senior product, product designer, senior product designer, product manager
```

#### **Sensitive/Domain Words**
```
❌ adult, adult content, nsfw, consumer apps
```

### 3. **Smart Allowed Phrases System**

#### **Keep These Even If Individual Words Are Blacklisted**
```
✅ mobile app design, mobile app, mobile design
✅ product design, product strategy, product lifecycle
✅ content design, content strategy
✅ cross-functional collaboration, cross-functional teams
✅ user experience, user interface, user journey
✅ design system, design tokens, design ops
✅ end-to-end design, end-to-end ownership
```

### 4. **Advanced Filtering Rules**

#### **Word-Level Filtering**
- **Minimum length**: 4+ characters (unless whitelisted)
- **POS-based gate**: Must contain ≥1 noun
- **Drop single adjectives/adverbs** and verb stubs
- **Fragment detection**: Incomplete clauses removed

#### **Phrase-Level Filtering**
- **Leading/trailing stopwords**: Automatically trimmed
- **Consecutive duplicates**: "product design design" → "product design"
- **Blacklist word combinations**: Any phrase containing blacklisted words is dropped

### 5. **Separate Tag Extraction**

#### **Domain Tags** (Shown Separately, Not Counted Toward Coverage)
```
🏷️ consumer apps, fully remote, europe, eu, adult content
```

#### **Role Tags** (Shown Separately, Not Counted Toward Coverage)
```
👔 senior product designer, product designer, ux designer
```

#### **Dropped Examples** (For QA Purposes)
```
❌ senior, product, designer, for, apps, fully, remote, europe, please, join
```

## 🔍 **Processing Pipeline**

### **Complete 10-Step Pipeline**
1. **Tokenize** → Split text into words
2. **Detect N-Grams** → Find bigrams and trigrams with strict filtering
3. **Drop Blacklisted Phrases** → Remove exact phrase matches
4. **Add Allowed Phrases** → Include meaningful combinations
5. **Normalize & Clean** → Apply phrase normalization
6. **Extract Single Words** → Apply minimum signal rules
7. **Add Whitelist Items** → Include category-approved terms
8. **Score & Rank** → Calculate relevance scores
9. **Deduplicate** → Remove near-duplicates using advanced rules
10. **Extract Tags** → Separate domain, role, and dropped examples

### **Filtering Logic**
```
Input: "Senior Product Designer for consumer apps. Fully remote, Europe."
Step 1: Tokenize → ['Senior', 'Product', 'Designer', 'for', 'consumer', 'apps', 'Fully', 'remote', 'Europe']
Step 2: Filter → Drop 'Senior', 'Product', 'Designer', 'for', 'Fully', 'remote', 'Europe'
Step 3: Keep → 'consumer apps' (allowed phrase)
Step 4: Tags → domain_tags: ['consumer apps', 'fully remote', 'europe'], role_tags: ['senior product designer']
```

## 📊 **Test Results**

### **Test Case A: Senior Product Designer for consumer apps**
```
✅ KEEP: figma, discovery, usability testing, product design
❌ DROP: senior product, product designer, consumer apps (→ domain_tags)
❌ DROP: fully remote, europe, please, join, platform
✅ NO FRAGMENTS: end design, look, that never appear
```

### **Test Case B: Lead accessibility and interaction design**
```
✅ KEEP: accessibility, interaction design, mobile app, wireframes, user journey
❌ DROP: lone mobile, collaborate, engineers
```

### **Test Case C: Discovery → prototyping → usability testing**
```
✅ KEEP: discovery, prototyping, usability testing, design system, design tokens, figma
❌ DROP: standalone system, tokens, app
```

### **Test Case D: Adult content moderation**
```
✅ KEYWORDS: moderation (only meaningful term)
✅ DOMAIN_TAGS: ['adult content']
```

## 🚀 **Technical Implementation**

### **New Data Structures**
```python
# Strict category-based whitelist
WHITELIST = {
    'prototyping', 'usability testing', 'user research', 'accessibility', 
    'interaction design', 'discovery', 'ideation', 'end-to-end design', 'design systems',
    'figma', 'sketch', 'miro', 'jira', 'confluence', 'analytics',
    'wireframes', 'flows', 'journey maps', 'personas', 'design tokens',
    'agile', 'scrum', 'a/b testing', 'design ops',
    'conversion optimization', 'kpi', 'experimentation'
}

# Allowed phrases (keep even if individual words are blacklisted)
ALLOWED_PHRASES = {
    'mobile app design', 'product design', 'content design', 'cross-functional collaboration',
    'user experience', 'design system', 'end-to-end design'
}

# Enhanced phrase blacklist
PHRASE_BLACKLIST = {
    'fully', 'remote', 'europe', 'eu', 'relocation', 'visa', 'join', 'please',
    'client', 'clients', 'user', 'users', 'mobile', 'platform', 'content',
    'senior product', 'product designer', 'adult content', 'consumer apps'
}
```

### **Advanced Functions**
- **`extract_domain_tags()`**: Extract sensitive/domain-specific content
- **`extract_role_tags()`**: Extract role/level titles
- **`canonicalize_phrase()`**: Comprehensive phrase normalization
- **`deduplicate_keywords_advanced()`**: Sophisticated deduplication

### **Output Format**
```json
{
    "all_keywords": ["figma", "discovery", "usability testing"],
    "matched_keywords": ["figma", "discovery"],
    "missing_keywords": ["usability testing"],
    "bullet_suggestions": ["Implemented usability testing strategies..."],
    "score": 66.7,
    "textSimilarity": 20.8,
    "keywordCoverage": 66.7,
    "domain_tags": ["consumer apps", "fully remote"],
    "role_tags": ["senior product designer"],
    "dropped_examples": ["senior", "product", "designer", "for"]
}
```
